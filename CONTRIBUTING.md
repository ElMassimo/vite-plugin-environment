# How to contribute

## Reporting issues

If you think you've spotted a problem with this module, feel free to open up a
[new issue](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-environment/issues/new). There are a couple
of things you should check before doing so:

- Do you have the latest version of the plugin? If not, does updating to the latest
version fix your issue?
- Has somebody else [already reported](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-environment/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen) your issue? Feel free to comment or check-in on an existing issue that matches your own.
- Is your problem definitely to do with this module? For anything else, check the Vite.js repo instead.

## Fixing issues

If you've identified a fix to a new or existing issue, we welcome contributions!

- Commit and push your changes
- [Make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

## Adding features

If you think you have
a useful addition that doesn’t take long to create a pull request for, feel free
to go ahead and make it and strike up a discussion. With any non-trivial amount
of work, the best thing to do is [create an issue](https://github.com/ElMassimo/vite-plugin-environment/issues/new)
in which to discuss the feature, for the following reasons:

- We might have already planned to work on your suggested feature.
- We might disagree about whether the addition is worthwhile or not.
- We might agree that the addition is worthwhile but disagree with the implementation.

Use your best judgement. What we want to avoid here is anybody feeling like they’ve
wasted their time!
